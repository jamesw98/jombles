<button class="collapsible">Distance Drill (Group)</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>Without Hand Signals:</p>
        <p class="sublevel">One fencer leads the rest of the fencers</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The group is supposed to keep distance with the leader while the leader advances and retreats</p>
        <p class="sublevel">If the leader lunges, the group waits for him to recover, then lunges and recovers</p>
        <p>With Hand Signals:</p>
        <p class="sublevel">Same basic idea as without hand</p>
        <p class="sublevel">For this drill the leader can raise their left, right, or both hands</p>
        <p class="sublevel">Each hand/combo</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Italian Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>Each fencer has a glove</p>
        <p>Fencers come en guarde at advance lunge distance</p>
        <p>Alternating turns, the fencers use an advance lunge to attempt to hit the other</p>
        <p>During the attacking fencer's turn, the other may take as many retreats as they want</p>
        <p>After getting hit, switch attackers</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Smooth Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>One fencer has a glove</p>
        <p>This drill can done stationary or moving</p>
        <p>The fencer without a glove is trying to lunge and grab the glove</p>
        <p>The fencer with the glove can move the glove out of the way when the other lunges</p>
        <p>When doing this moving, the fencer w/o the glove is trying to manipulate distance</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Patterns</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This section is just a list of useful footwork patterns:</p>
        <p>Lunge >>> Recover Forward >>> Lunge >>> Recover</p>
        <p>Small Advance >>> Advance >>> Advance Lunge</p>
        <p>Small Advance >>> Advance >>> Jump Lunge (Balestra)</p>
        <p>Advance Lunge >>> Recover Forward >>> Jump Lunge</p>
        <p>2 Retreats >>> Advance Lunge >>> Recover Forward >>> Fleche</p>
        <p>Jump Lunge >>> Recover >>> Advance Lunge >>> Recover Forward >>> Fleche</p>
        <p>Advance >>> Retreat >>> Advance >>> Check Forward >>> Lunge</p>
        <p>Retreat >>> Advance >>> Retreat >>> Check Back >>> Fleche</p>
</div>

<div class="table">Bladework</div>

<button class="collapsible">Get Away and Go Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This is essentially a bladework version of the smooth drill</p>
        <p>The only allowed footwork is advance lunges and retreats</p>
        <p>The attacker is allowed on advance lunge in attempt to hit the defending fencer in the shoulder or lower</p>
        <p>While the attacker is advance lunging, the defender is allowed as many retreats as they want</p>
        <p>Once the attacker recovers, the rolls switch</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Tea Tray Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>The only valid footwork in this drill is a lunge</p>
        <p>This is essentially a bouting drill</p>
        <p>The fencers come en guarde at lunge distance</p>
        <p>The fencers are trying to hit each other, using any bladework action they want</p>
        <p>The only thing the fencers cannot do, is move their back foot, they can lunge and recover though</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Basic Parry Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>(!) NOTE (!) this is mainly an epee drill and requires modification for the other weapons</p>
        <p>(!) NOTE (!) this drill assumes right handed fencer vs. right handed fencer</p>
        <p>This drill can be done moving or stationary</p>
        <p>There are two roles: coach and student</p>
        <p>The coach can choose between three cues to give the student</p>
        <p>1. extend to the inside of the hand/elbow, cue for circle 6</p>
        <p>2. extend to the outside of the hand/elbow, cue for parry 6</p>
        <p>3. extend to the chest, cue for parry 4</p>
        <p>The student must recognize what the proper parry is and execute a parry and riposte to the proper target</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Parry Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This drill can be done with any parry</p>
        <p>There are two roles, attacker and defender</p>
        <p>The attacker extends to a line and advances</p>
        <p>The defender parry and retreats</p>
        <p>This repeats two more times, except on the third time, the defender does not retreat and ripostes</p>
        <p>Alternate attacker/defender roles</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">EDGAR-Janowski Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>There are two roles, attacker and defender</p>
        <p>The attacker can only attack, no retreating</p>
        <p>The defender can only defend, no attacks except counters or attack in prep</p>
        <p>This is essentially a bouting drill, once a fencer is hit, reset distance and start again</p>
        <p>Switch roles once 5 total touches have been scored</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Modified Priority Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This is a bouting drill</p>
        <p>One fencer starts with two touches, the other starts with none</p>
        <p>Set a timer for 60, 30, or 20 seconds</p>
        <p>The goal of the drill is for the fencer with no touches to tie the score</p>
        <p>If the fencer that started with no touches gets two touches without the other fencer scoring, they win</p>
        <p>If the fencer that started with touches ends up with more touches than the other with no time left, they win</p>
        <p>If the fencer that started with touches gets a touche, the fencer that started with none now has to match that score</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Cat and Mouse Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>There are three levels of progression for this drill</p>
        <p>Each level has an attacker an a defender</p>
        <p>At each level, no one is really leading footwork, but the attacker is trying to get close enough to attack</p>
        <p>Level 1:</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The only action the attacker has is a lunge to any target</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The only action the defender has is a retreat to get away from the lunge</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The goal of the attacker is to manipulate distance so they can hit the defender</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The goal of the defender is to not get hit</p>
        <p>Level 2:</p>
        <p class="sublevel">Building off of level 1</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The defender now has the option to parry and riposte</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The attacker now has the option to retreat from the riposte</p>
        <p>Level 3:</p>
        <p class="sublevel">Building off of level 2</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The attacker now has the option to feint disengage from the defender's parry</p>
        <p class="sublevel">The defender has the same options plus retreating from the lunge after the disengage</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Target Drill/Game</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This works best with epee, but could work with foil and sabre with modification</p>
        <p>You have to have a ref for this drill, even in epee</p>
        <p>One fencer is just fencing a normal bout to 5</p>
        <p>The other fencer has a specific target to hit, that the ref gave them</p>
        <p>If they hit this target once, they automatically win</p>
        <p>This could be modified for RoW weapons by using actions instead of targets</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Three, Six, Nine Drill</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This is a bouting drill, done on a strip with electic scoring, fencers are fencing to ten</p>
        <p>Once a fencer gets to 3,6, or 9 points, the other fencer gets to take an action away from the fencer that just scored</p>
        <p>For newer fencers the action can be less specific or they could even take away a target area</p>
        <p>For more experience fencers, the actions should be fairly complex</p>
        <p>See the next section for valid and invalid action examples to take away</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Three, Six, Nine Examples</button>
<div class="content">
        <p>This section contains examples of valid and invalid actions to take away in the 3,6,9 Drill</p>
        <p>Valid:</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot parry 6 riposte" this is a valid action as the action is specific</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot counter attack" this is valid, but could be more specific</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot counter attack off my lunge" this is a better version of the previous example</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot fleche in the line of 6" this is a good, specific action to take</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot feint-disengage and riposte" very experienced fencers should use things like this</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot hit my elbow" beginners can use things like this</p>
        <p class="valid">"You cannot score on your end of the strip" this is technically valid, but should be avoided</p>
        <p>Invalid:</p>
        <p class="invalid">"You cannot lunge" this is not valid, as it is not specific enough</p>
        <p class="invalid">"You cannot parry 6" this is also not specific enough</p>
        <p class="invalid">"You cannot advance" this is not specific enough</p>
